Fraud Detection - Online PaymentsÂ¶
This project is a machine learning classification model to detect fraudulent transactions in online payments. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, with far more non-fraudulent transactions than fraudulent ones. The project explores multiple algorithms and techniques to address the imbalance and improve the detection of fraud.

Dataset
The dataset contains information about online payment transactions, including:

Transaction Type (e.g., cash-out, transfer)
Amount
Origin and Destination Balances (before and after the transaction)
Flags for potential fraud.
